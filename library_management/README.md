## Explanations

1. **Header Files and Structure Definition**
   - **`#include <iostream>`**: Includes the standard input/output library, allowing the use of `cin` and `cout`.
   - **`#include <string>`**: Includes the string library for working with strings.
   - **`using namespace std;`**: Allows using standard library functions and classes without prefixing them with `std::`.
   - **`struct Book`**: Defines a structure named `Book` with two properties: `title` and `author`, both of type `string`.

2. **Variable Definitions**
   - **`const int MAX_BOOKS = 100;`**: Defines a constant for the maximum number of books that can be stored.
   - **`Book library[MAX_BOOKS];`**: Declares an array of type `Book` to hold up to 100 books.
   - **`int bookCount = 0;`**: Initializes a variable to count the number of books currently stored.

3. **Add Book Function**
   - **`void addBook()`**: Defines a function to add a new book.
   - **`if (bookCount >= MAX_BOOKS)`**: Checks if the array is full. If yes, it displays an error message and exits the function.
   - **`cin.ignore();`**: Ignores any leftover newline character from previous input.
   - **`getline(cin, library[bookCount].title);`**: Reads the book title from the user and stores it in the array.
   - **`getline(cin, library[bookCount].author);`**: Reads the author's name and stores it.
   - **`bookCount++;`**: Increments the count of books.
   - **`cout << "Book added successfully." << endl;`**: Displays a success message.

4. **Display Books Function**
   - **`void displayBooks()`**: Defines a function to display all stored books.
   - **`if (bookCount == 0)`**: Checks if there are no books. If true, it displays a message indicating the library is empty.
   - **`cout << "--- List of Books ---" << endl;`**: Prints a header for the book list.
   - **`for (int i = 0; i < bookCount; i++)`**: Loops through the books in the array.
   - **`cout << i + 1 << ". " << library[i].title << " - " << library[i].author << endl;`**: Displays each book's number, title, and author.

5. **Search Book Function**
   - **`void searchBook()`**: Defines a function to search for a book by title.
   - **`string searchTitle;`**: Declares a variable to store the title to search.
   - **`cout << "Enter the book title to search: ";`**: Prompts the user for the book title.
   - **`getline(cin, searchTitle);`**: Gets the title from the user.
   - **`for (int i = 0; i < bookCount; i++)`**: Loops through the stored books.
   - **`if (library[i].title == searchTitle)`**: Checks if the current book's title matches the search title.
   - **Displays the found book's details**: If a match is found, it prints the title and author.
   - **`cout << "Book not found." << endl;`**: Displays a message if no match is found.

6. **Main Function**
   - **`int main()`**: The main function where program execution starts.
   - **`int choice;`**: Declares a variable to store the user's menu choice.
   - **`do { ... } while (choice != 4);`**: A do-while loop that runs until the user selects the exit option.
   - **Menu Display**: Displays options for adding, displaying, searching books, and exiting.
   - **`switch (choice)`**: Handles user input and calls the corresponding function based on the choice.
   - **Exit Message**: When option 4 is selected, it displays an exiting message.
   - **`return 0;`**: Indicates successful program termination.
